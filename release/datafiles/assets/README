# Blender Asset Bundle

Asset library provided by blender.org. This is a work in progress. Eventually these assets should be available for easy download from blender.org.

## Setup

Steps to use the source data of the bundle and contribute to it.

* **Install SVN**
  * You need to have SVN installed.
  * On Windows an SVN client like [SlikSVN](https://sliksvn.com/download/) or [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/) will work. These clients provide GUI tools too, but the following will assume command-line usage.
* **Download the SVN repository**
  * Open a terminal and navigate to a directory you want the directory with the bundle to be downloaded to.
  * `svn checkout https://svn.blender.org/svnroot/bf-blender/trunk/lib/assets blender-asset-bundle`.
  * This creates a `blender-asset-bundle/` directory with the .blend files.
* **Do changes** 
  * Do any changes to the .blend's inside the `blender-asset-bundle` directory.
  * To get the changes online, they can be committed (read below).
* **Add new files**
  * After adding new files (typically new .blend's with assets), SVN has to made aware of these like this:
    * `svn add new_file1.blend new_file2.blend`
  * Note that for now all assets should be in a single directory, no sub-directories (which the Asset Browser doesn't support properly yet).
* **Commit changes**
  * After edits were done or files were added, it's time to commit the changes (if you have commit rights). `svn commit -m "Some commit title"`.
  * Please give the commit a descriptive but brief title. For advanced commit message use `svn commit` only which opens a text editor to enter the message.

## Layout

* publish: bundled with official releases
* testing: bundled with development branches, work in progress
* working: not bundled, work in progress
