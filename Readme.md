** Info **
Not easy to make my own 3D Modeling and take a lot to make this one so I will make a fork from Blender as base for all 3D,
all included here so I want to improve and adding some nice features in futur. Hope it will motivate me as well :D


Blackdot
=======

Blackdot is the free and open source 3D creation suite based from Blender and it is inspired from Softimage XSI.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,
motion tracking and video editing.


Plan for adding/improving to Blackdot
============

- [] UI from Softimage XSI
- [] Tools in 3D modeling
- [] ICE system
	- [] Particles
	- [] Deform
	- [] Kinematic
	- [] CrowdFX
