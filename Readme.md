 Info
-------------
*** Not easy to make my own 3D Modeling and take a lot to make this one so I will make a fork from Blender as base for all 3D, all included here so I want to improve and adding some nice features in futur. Hope it will motivate me as well :D ***


Blackdot
-------------

Blackdot is the free and open source 3D creation suite based from Blender v. 4.1.1 and it is inspired from Softimage XSI.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline-modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,
motion tracking and video editing.


Plan for adding/improving to Blackdot
-------------

- [] UI from Softimage XSI
- [] Tools in 3D modeling (based on Softimage XSI)
- [] OOM (Oriented Object Modeling)
- [] Metamesh modeling
- [] ICE system (based from geomety nodes)
	- [] Particles
	- [] Deform
	- [] Kinematic
	- [] CrowdFX
- [] Hair system
- [] Advanced 3D painting
- [] New NPR shading
- [] 3D Rendending
	- [] Fujiyama
	- [] Appleseed
- [] 3D Tracking
- [] Cloth system
- [] Advanced VFX compositing
- [] Advanced video editor 
- [] AngelScript editor


Development
-------------

It will support to Vulkan from current coming to Blender.

It will support to AngelScript (WIP).

Thanks
-------------

Blackdot give to tribute at Daniel Langlois and I thank much him the creator of Softimage XSI, a 3d software loved by a lot of 3d Artists around the world. 
I thank as well to the french man and developer named Stephane Rehel for first 3D software and open source from Softimage 3D classic with his software as Moonlight Creator and later Moonlight Atelier. 
I am inspired by two peoples and hope I will bright to you for enjoy this Blackdot too 3D and to be inspired by me for you as well :) !
Thanks to Ton Roosendaal for the awesome Blender and his team are super amazing too.
