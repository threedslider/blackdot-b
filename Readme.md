Introduction

Blackdot 3D is free, modern and open source for 3D creation, it's inspired and clone from Softimage XSI and Moonlight Creator, 
it gets more modern on UI, it brights great tool on 3D, NURBS tool, VFX tool, BRDF material and powerful rendering as pathtracing.
So from now it's wip. I will work on Vulkan, 3D modelling, rendering and later I will integrate animation and ICE similar later too.
