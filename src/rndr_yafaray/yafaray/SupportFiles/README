This patches are provided here for convenience only and with no warranty of anything whatsoever.

This patches were originaly created by developers outside YafaRay Team,
so if this don't work for you please find some help on the SWIG forums, bugtracker and/or mailing list

Both patches must be applied in level one (patch -p1) inside SWIG's source folder and require latest SWIG 2.0.x sources in order to work.

Instructions to build swig are beyond the scope of this document, please go to SWIG's site for instructions on it and on where and how to get SWIG's sources.

Is a known fact that on some systems only swig-pycapsule.patch is required while in others
both patches are needed in order to successfuly build Python 3.2 bindings for YafaRay,
so test first with pycapsule patch and then if it doesn't work try the pyslice one too.

This patches are here only temporarily and they can (and will) be removed without prior notice.

Remember that this are only convenience files not officially supported nor created by YafaRay Team.
